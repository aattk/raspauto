## Creating a Telegram Bot

To create our own bot account, we need to start talking to the BotFather bot. Click on the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) link, then after pressing the ``START`` button you will start talking. You will be greeted by the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)'s help message. You can create your own bot by reading this message.
After sending the ``/newbot`` command as a message, it will ask for the name of the bot. Right now we'll name it My Telegram Bot. You can give any name you want. It will then ask you for a username for your telegram bot. There are only 2 terms. It ends with either ``Bot or _bot``. For example, usernames such as ``MyTelegramBot``, ``mytelegram_bot`` should be used.

After choosing a username, BotFather will send you a message containing your bot's telegram ``url`` and ``token`` value. If you want, you can change or add features to your bot. By sending the ``/help`` command as a message, BotFather will send the message that helps you what you can do.


## How to install?
This library works with Python 3. Please Install Python3.

``` 
sudo apt-get install python3 
```

Let's load the Raspauto library using pip.

```
sudo pip3 install raspauto
```

Create a python file and write the code at the bottom

``` python
import raspauto
ra = raspauto.set("telegram_bot_token","bot_password")
```
**Bot Password** : You set the secret password for bot usage.

**Remember**     : You must send the password you set for the first use in plain text.

If there is an error in activating or deactivating the button, please give permission to write to the database with the help of the command at the bottom.

```
sudo chmod 777 ra.sqlite
```

## How to add it to the beginning?
Download service file.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aattk/raspauto/master/demo/ra.service
```

Perform the copy operation to add to the beginning.

```
sudo cp ra.service /etc/systemd/system/ra.service
```

The python file name must be ``ra.py`` for this process to work. Also, the ``ra.py`` file should be under the folder ``/home/pi``. If you want to change it yourself. You can look at the sample service file under the demo folder.

We activate the service.

```
sudo systemctl enable ra.service
```

We start the operation of the system by rebooting.

```
sudo reboot
```
